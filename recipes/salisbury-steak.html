        <li>1/2 cup panko break crumbs</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
        <li>1/2 (1 ounce) package dry onion soup mix</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <h2>Gravy</h2>

        <li>2 cups fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1 sweet onion, sliced</li>

        <li></li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <li>Mix ground sirlon, panko bread crumbs, egg, milk and 1/2 packet onion soup mix, worcestershire sauce, and black pepper together in a large bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a skillet over medium heat. Cook patties in hot skilles until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a seperate skillet over medium-high heat. Saute mushrooms and onion in melted butter until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir flour and remaining dry onion soup mix into the mushroom mixture; cook and stir until flour is integrated fully, about 1 minute. Stream beef stock and water over the mushroom mixture while stirring continually; bring to a simmer, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring frequently, until the liquid thickens, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Lie the browned steaks into the gravy; simmer until steaks are firm and gray in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
